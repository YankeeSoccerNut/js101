  // 1.  Strings
  // 2.  Numbers (can contain float or integer but not typed as such)
  // 3.  Booleans
  // 4.  Arrays
  // 5.  Objects

  // Variables created dynamically but must use var to create.  Note:  browser will allow unless "use strict" is in the script.  BAD PRACTICE TO NOT DECLARE VARIABLES.
  // scope rules apply!  window (essentially Global), function, prototype method.  var is used once per variable...no need to declare again

//incrementors...
// postfixing i++  is same as i+=1 (which can be used)
// postfixing increment operation is the LAST operation
// prefixing incerments as the FIRST operation in the scope  ++i

//prompt method...2 args...message, default response (optional)

//conditionals....similar to Python
// = is assignment operator
// == is comparison
// === is same as == but checks datatype as well

//Math is built into javascript...no need to import
